I am here to upskill and build practical software development experience that prepares me for an entry-level role in tech.
By week 30, my goal is to complete and deploy well-scoped projects that demonstrate my ability to design and ship real applications.
I want to develop  strong foundation in problem-solving, clean code etc.
I want to be able to build flexible skills that can apply to any software development environments.
My target users are recruiters, and startups.
